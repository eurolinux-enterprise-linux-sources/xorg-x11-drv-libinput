    Fix "left handed" property not set on all pointers
    
    Remove conditional that prevents the LIBINPUT_PROP_LEFT_HANDED{,DEFAULT}
    properties from being set on all pointer devices (only the first got it).
    This appears to be a debugging left-over accidentally merged in
    6d3bd4544a6a2f194fa.

    man: note that we don't do /dev/input/by-id or /dev/input/by-path
    
    For logind-setups we need to match the path libinput wants to open with the
    Option Device path that the device has so we know when to return the
    server-fd. This doesn't work for by-id or by-path because libinput resolves
    those (through udev) to the actual eventX node so our paths look different
    when they are the same device.
    
    This could be fixed but since this is easy enough to work around with a
    InputClass section and rather a niche case, it's not really worth the effort.

    Apply the capabilities checks on subdevices when applying the config
    
    Properties are initialized on the correct devices only but on resume we'd just
    blindly apply the config from our device. Depending on the resume order, this
    would mean we'd apply a previously set config with a default config.
    
    Example:
    * pointer device with keyboard subdevice
    * pointer device exports natural scrolling, keyboard device does not and
      remains at default (off)
    * client enables natural scrolling on the pointer device
    * VT switch away, VT switch back
    * pointer device gets enabled first, enables natural scrolling on the
      libinput device
    * keyboard device gets enabled second, resets to the default value

    Move the subdevice capabilities check into the properties
    
    87f9fe3a6fafe60134c6's intention was to not create properties that a subdevice
    doesn't have configuration options for (i.e. if you have a pointer+keyboard
    device, don't expose tapping configuration on the keyboard subdevice).
    
    The result was messy, the checker function had a confusing triple-negation and
    some properties weren't checked - e.g. left-handed was allowed for touch/tablet
    but not for pointer, dwt was allowed for any device.
    
    Fix this by moving the check into the property init function directly and
    inverting the helper function to be easier to read.

    Only initialize properties that match capabilities on a subdevice
    
    If a device is split into multiple subdevices, usually pointer+keyboard, we
    initialized properties matching the libinput device on both devices. This
    results in the keyboard having e.g. a Accel Speed or Left Handed settings even
    though it cannot send any events of that type.
    
    Filter by capabilities on the subdevice so we only get those properties that

    Post a motion event after proximity events
    
    This patch splits the meat of xf86libinput_handle_tablet_axis into a helper
    function xf86libinput_post_tablet_motion(), to be called right after we send
    the proximity in event.
    
    Clients that don't handle proximity (e.g. all XI2 clients) don't see the
    coordinates we send along with the proximity events. And, for historical
    reasons, they may not look at the coordinates in button events. So a device
    that comes into proximity and immediately sends a tip down button event
    doesn't send a motion event, causing the client to think the tip down was at
    whatever the last known position was (before previous prox-out).
    
    The practical effect is that when a user tries to draw a few dots, they end up
    being connected to each other.

    Implement stylus pressure curve support
    
    Takes a 4-point cubic bezier curve as input and maps the pressure coordinates
    to the values outlined by this curve. This is an extension of the current
    implementation in the xf86-input-wacom driver which only allows the two center
    control points to be modified.
    
    Over the years a few users have noted that the wacom driver's pressure curve
    makes it impossible to cap the pressure at a given value. Given our bezier
    implementation here, it's effectively a freebie to add configurability of the
    first and last control points. We do require all control points' x coordinates
    to be in ascending order.

    Calculate the required scroll distance based on the angle
    
    For a mouse with a click angle of 15 degrees things are unchanged. For devices
    with angles less than 10, the current code scrolled way too fast. Because the
    angle wasn't used anywhere, each tick would count as full scroll wheel event,
    a slight movement of the wheel would thus scroll as much as a large movement
    on a normal mouse.
    
    Fix this by taking the actual click angle of the device into account. We
    calculate some multiple of the angle that's close enough to the default 15
    degrees of the wheel and then require that many click events to hit the full
    scroll distance. For example, a mouse with a click angle of 3 degrees now
    requires 5 clicks to trigger a full legacy scroll button event.
    
    XI2.1 clients get the intermediate events (i.e. in this case five times
    one-fifth of the scroll distance) and can thus scroll smoothly, or more
    specifically in smaller events than usual.

    If the parent libinput_device is unavailable, create a new one
    
    The parent device ref's the libinput device during pre_init and unref's it
    during DEVICE_INIT, so the copy is lost. During DEVICE_ON, the libinput device
    is re-added and ref'd, this one stays around now. But the takeaway is: unless
    the device is enabled, no libinput device reference is available.
    
    If a device is a mixed pointer + keyboard device, a subdevice is created
    during a WorkProc. The subdevice relied on the parent's libinput_device being
    available and didn't even check for it. This WorkProc usually runs after
    the parent's DEVICE_ON, so in most cases all is well.
    
    But when running without logind and the server is vt-switched away, the parent
    device only runs PreInit and DEVICE_INIT but never DEVICE_ON, causing the
    subdevice to burn, crash, and generally fail horribly when it dereferences the
    parent's libinput device.
    
    Fix this because we have global warming already and don't need to burn more
    things and also because it's considered bad user experience to have the
    server crash. The simple fix is to check the parent device first and if it is
    unavailable, create a new one because it will end up disabled as well anyway,
    so the ref goes away as well. The use-case where the parent somehow gets
    disabled but the subdevice doesn't is a bit too niche to worry about.
    
    This doesn't happen with logind because in that case we don't get a usable fd
    while VT-switched away, so we can't even run PreInit and never get this far
    (see the paused fd handling in the xfree86 code for that). It can be
    reproduced by setting AutoEnableDevices off, but why would you do that,
    seriously.

    Always delay hotplugging subdevices
    
    Avoid creating new devices from within the input thread which was the case for
    tablet tools. It requires a lot more care about locking and has a potential to
    mess up things.
    
    Instead, schedule a WorkProc and buffer all events until we have the device
    created. Once that's done, replay the event sequence so far. If the device
    comes into proximity and out again before we manage to create the new device
    we just ditch the whole sequence and wait for the next proximity in.

    conf: drop libinput to below the other drivers
    
    This is the continuation of 3f569ec493e, dropping libinput below the remaining
    drivers. Wacom and synaptics already sort higher anyway (see wacom commit
    0da5cd54 and synaptics commit 59e5db025). evdev remains the catchall
    basic fallback driver and is overwritten by libinput. The two drivers affected
    by this patch are joystick and vmmouse.
    
    joystick is a niche driver and drives devices libinput doesn't handle anyway
    so there is no need to override. If a user installs it, presumably it is to
    use it.
    
    vmmouse is a niche driver and does not assign itself anymore for newer kernel
    drivers (see vmmouse commit 576e8123 from Oct 2014). So if vmmouse is
    installed it can safely sort higher than libinput.
    
    Note: this is upstream behavior, distributions have to work out the wanted
    behavior themselves by renaming the config snippets accordingly.

    Fix proximity events
    
    Two bugs caused proximity events to be discarded. First, on proximity out
    posting through pDev would be discarded because pDev is the parent device that
    we use as a base for hotplugging the real devices for each tool from. That
    device never sends events though, doing so will see the event discarded in the
    server.
    
    Second, if the tool already exists don't just exit, send the proximity event
    first. To unify the three paths where we do send the events simply move them
    down to the exit phase of the function.

    Add tablet pad support
    
    Modelled to be mostly compatible to the xf86-input-wacom driver behavior. The
    pad gets 7 axes, the first three of which are mute and the others are always
    available but obviously only send events when the axis is there.
    
    The strip axes are incompatible, the wacom driver merely forwards the device
    events (which are a bitshifted value), libinput normalizes it and we just
    expand this back into an integer range. Let's see how we go with this.

    60 sorts higher than the other drivers (evdev has 10, synaptics, wacom and
    others have 50) so we keep the same order.
    
    This is part of a two-step solution, the other half is renaming the
    xf86-input-wacom's config snippet to sort higher than libinput's.
    
    Currently libinput picks up devices that are (for now) destined to the wacom
    driver. Since the wacom driver is more of a leaf package than libinput, the
    best option here is to make the wacom driver sort higher and let users
    uninstall it when not needed. To avoid crowding the 90-* space where users
    usually have custom config snippets, drop libinput down to 60 and bump wacom
    up.

    Add support for tablet tools
    
    Use two new internal capabilities, CAP_TABLET and CAP_TABLET_TOOL. If a
    libinput tablet device is added, add an X device without any classes. This
    device will not send events, but once we have pad support in libinput we
    may be able to this the pad device.
    
    When a tool comes into proximity, create a new X device for that serial number
    and start sending events through it. Since the X device only represents a
    single serial number/type combination, some of the wacom-specific
    configuration options fall away. This only matters in the case of multiple
    tools, in which case a per-tool configuration is preferable anyway, so we
    don't lose anything here.
    
    Gesture support only applied to the touch parts on the device, we don't
    deal with this here specifically - that event node is handled by libinput as
    touchscreen or touchpad.
    
    This already works with GIMP and clients that don't rely on any
    wacom-driver-specific properties. Configuration clients like
    gnome-settings-daemon will need to change to handle new properties, to be
    added as we go along.

    Drain the fd after opening
    
    Make sure we don't send any events that may have been enqueued before we
    initialized ourselves. Specifically, if we're using systemd-logind the fd
    remains open when we disable/enable the device, allowing events to queue up on
    the fd. These events are then replayed once the device is re-opened.
    
    This is not the case when VT-switching, in that case logind closes the fd for
    us.

    Split mixed pointer/keyboard devices into two separate X devices
    
    The server struggles with devices that are both, the protocol (especially XI2)
    requires a fairly strict separation of pointer vs keyboard devices. Though the
    server has a couple of hacks to route events correctly, mixed
    devices still experience bugs like [1].
    
    Instead of advertising the device as a single mixed device, split the device
    into two X devices, one with only a pointer/touch component, one with only a
    keyboard component. This ensures that the device is effectively attached to
    both the VCP and the VCK, something the XI2 protocol doesn't really allow.
    
    This patch drops the keyboard capability on a mixed device, duplicates the
    input options and attributes and queues a NewInputDeviceRequest call. The new
    device only has the keyboard capability but is otherwise unchanged. The
    wacom driver has used this approach for years.
    
    The WorkProc is necessary to avoid inconsistent state, the server doesn't
    handle a NewInputDeviceRequest during PreInit well.
    
    The approach:
    During pre-init we create a struct xf86libinput_device with the
    libinput_device and a unique ID. The child device has that ID added to the
    options and will look for the other device during its pre-init. The two
    devices then share the xf86libinput_device struct.
    
    We only have a single epollfd for all devices  and the server calls read_input
    on the first device in the list with the epollfd as pInfo->fd. That shared
    struct is used as the userdata on the libinput_device we get back from the
    event, and each device is in the xorg_list device_list of that shared struct.
    We loop through those to find the ones with the right capabilities and
    post the event through that device.
    
    Since devices can be enabled and disabled independently, the rest of the code
    makes sure that we only ever add the device to libinput when the first shared
    device is enabled, and remove it accordingly.
    
    The server uses pInfo->major/minor to detect if another device is using the
    same path for a logind-controlled fd. If so, it reuses that device's
    pInfo->fd and sets the "fd" option to that value. That pInfo->fd is the
    libinput epollfd though, not the actual device fd.
    
    This doesn't matter for us, since we manage the fds largely ourselves and the
    pInfo->fd we use is the epollfd anyway. On unplug however, the udev code
    triggers a device removal for all devices, including the duplicated ones. When
    we disable device, we restore the pInfo->fd from the "fd" option so that the
    server can request logind to close the fd.
    
    That only works if the "fd" option is correct, otherwise the server asks
    logind to close the epollfd and everyone is unhappy.

    Revert "Split mixed pointer/keyboard devices into two separate X devices"
    
    When using logind, this causes the server to hang when a split device is
    unplugged. The reason is mostly in the server, when open the device by
    requesting the logind fd, the server loops through the device list to check if
    any other device has the same major/minor (see systemd_logind_take_fd()) and
    returns the pInfo->fd for that device instead of requesting the fd again from
    logind.
    
    For libinput devices, the pInfo->fd is the epollfd, not the actual device, so
    our second device gets the epollfd assigned. When the devices are removed, we
    keep the device fd open and release the epollfd through logind.
    
    This reverts commit c943739a2bfd4c380db0b21bc35b73deb7496c8a.

    Revamp server fd opening
    
    The server already stores the server-fd in the options, so we only need to run
    through the list of current devices, find a match and extract that fd from the
    options. Less magic in our driver and it gives us a pInfo handle in
    open_restricted which we'll can use for xf86OpenSerial().

    Add an option to disable horizontal scrolling
    
    libinput always has horizontal scrolling enabled and punts the decision when
    to scroll horizontally to the toolkit/widget. This is the better approach, but
    while we have a stack that's not ready for that, and in the X case likely
    never will be fully ready provide an option to disable horizontal scrolling.
    
    This option doesn't really disable horizontal scrolling, it merely discards
    any horizontal scroll delta. libinput will still think it's scrolling.

    Add drag lock support
    
    First, why is this here and not in libinput: drag lock should be implemented
    in the compositor (not in libinput) so it can provide feedback when it
    activates and grouped in with other accessibility features. That will work for
    Wayland but in X the compositor cannot filter button events - only the server
    and the drivers can.
    
    This patch adds mostly the same functionality that evdev provides with two
    options on how it works:
    * a single button number configures the given button to lock the next button
      pressed in a logically down state until a press+ release of that same button
      again
    * a set of button number pairs configures each button with the to-be-locked
      logical button, i.e. a pair of "1 3" will hold 3 logically down after a
      button 1 press
    
    The property and the xorg.conf options take the same configuration as the
    evdev driver (though the property has a different prefix, libinput instead of
    Evdev).
    
    The behavior difference to evdev is in how releases are handled, evdev sends
    the release on the second button press event, this implementation sends the
    release on the second release event.

    Rename main source file to x86libinput.c
    
    To avoid conflict and confusion with libinput's sources. This was originally
    triggered by needing a header file for the driver which cannot be named
    libinput.h. That need went away after other refacturing, but we might as well
    rename it now, sooner or later we'll need a xf86libinput.h file.
    
    Can't do much about the libinput-properties header though, not worth breaking
    other projects and it's namespaced into /usr/include/xorg anyway.

    Use the new unaccelerated valuator ValuatorMask features
    
    SDL Games like openarena rely on relative input that's handled by the DGA code
    in the server. That code casts the driver's input data to int and sends it to
    the client. libinput does pointer acceleration for us, so sending any deltas
    of less than 1 (likely for slow movements) ends up being 0.
    
    Use the new ValuatorMask accelerated/unaccelerated values to pass the
    unaccelerated values along, the server can then decide what to do with it.

    Only init abs axes if we don't have acceleration
    
    A lot of devices (mainly MS input devices) have abs axes on top of the
    relative axes. Those axes are usually mute but with the current code we set up
    absolute axes for those devices. Relative events are then scaled by the server
    which makes the device appear slow.
    
    As an immediate fix always prefer relative axes and only set up absolute axes
    if the device has a calibration matrix but no pointer acceleration.
    This may mess up other devices where the relative axes are dead, we'll deal
    with this when it comes.

    Ignore property changes if the device is disabled
    
    If the device is present but disabled, the server will still call into
    SetProperty. We don't have a libinput device to back it up in this case,
    causing a null-pointer dereference.
    
    This is a bug specific to this driver that cannot easily be fixed. All
    other drivers can handle property changes even if no device is present,
    here we rely on libinput to make the final call. But without a device
    path/fd we don't have a libinput reference.
    
    The protocol doesn't mention this case, so let's pick BadMatch as the
    least wrong error code. And put a warning in the log, this needs a
    workaround in the client.
    
    Also, if we get here and the device is on, then that's definitely a bug,
    warn about that.

    Reapply configuration at DEVICE_ON
    
    The driver ignored my xorg configuration. Maybe I am doing something wrong,
    but I tried to track down the error and came up with this solution.
    
    The device is closed after DEVICE_INIT so we need to apply configuration
    options at DEVICE_ON.

    Support server-side fds
    
    libinput's device handling and server-side fd handling are a bit of a
    mismatch, so this is hackier than one would hope for.
    
    The server sets pInfo->fd and the options "fd" and "device".
    The server requires pInfo->fd to be the one triggering select(2) to call the
    correct pInfo->read_input. We can't pass an fd to use into libinput, all we
    have is the open_restricted callback. That callback gives us the context, but
    not the pInfo with the fd we want.
    
    The solution:
    1) In PreInit, store the patch + fd combination in a driver-wide list. Search
    that list for an fd in open_restricted, return the pre-openend fd.
    
    2) Overwrite all devices' pInfo->fd with the libinput epollfd. In this driver
    we don't care about which device read_input is called on, we get the correct
    pInfo to post events from through the struct libinput_device of the libinput
    events.
    
    3) When a device is closed, swap the real fd back in so systemd-logind closes the
    right fd.
    
    This saves us worrying about keeping the right refcount on who currently has
    the fd set to the libinput fd. We just set it for all devices, let the server
    figure out which device to call (the first in inputInfo.devices) and we only
    need to remember to swap it back during DEVICE_OFF.
    
    If the server calls close on a pInfo->fd without telling the driver, that's a
    bug anyway.
    
    This patch also drops the pInfo->fd = -1 calls, they've been unnecessary since
    at least 1.11, possibly earlier.

commit 8d6019c786febc55cf6c214fbecc44d70eba29be
Author: Peter Hutterer <peter.hutterer@who-t.net>

    Expose properties for the various configuration settings.
    
    The property support isn't ideal, the server relies on the driver to check
    first if a setting is possible, applying the setting itself cannot fail.
    Thus we can't just check the libinput config status code, which matters mostly
    in the sendevents property where we simply check that only a single bit is set
    and that the supported modes are equal or more to the requested mode.

    Fix scrolling jumps
    
    libinput currently scales wheel events by DEFAULT_AXIS_STEP_DISTANCE,
    which is currently 10.
    We may be able to find the value automatically, but it would require
    some dark codings that may not be robust.
    For the time being, just duplicate the define in libinput.c and remember
    to update it if it is changed in the future.
